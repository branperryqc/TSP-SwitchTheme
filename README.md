I worked on this theme based upon lilbud's RetroPie theme he maded which you can see here:
(https://github.com/lilbud/es-theme-switch/tree/master) 

I updated and redesigned some of the icons but I'll complete it soon! üôè‚ú®
I added Click sound from Switch when you navigate to different games and the Music (BGM) from the ancestor of the Switch, the Wii U!
